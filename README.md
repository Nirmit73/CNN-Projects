### Image Segmentation using U-net

In simpler words, segmentation is assigning labels to each and every pixel of the image. Image segmentation is a method in which a digital image is broken down into various subgroups called Image segments which helps in reducing the complexity of the image to make further processing or analysis of the image simpler.
This project was part of my coursework and can be used as a reference for any other image dataset for image segmentation.
You just need change the path in the second cell of the jupyter notebook.

### Hand Sign Digit identifier

Created a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model to help identify 6 hand signs digit i.e 0-5. The train_signs.h5 and test_signs.h5 contains the train and test images respectively.
While downloading this notebook, don't forget to download all the required files and libraries along with datasets files.
